 * Did implement TextActionCell in pure F#, got everything compiled and running.
 * A wierd issue is that calling BindingObject.SetValue() not working, always get the
 * default value no matter what, can not fix it easily, so gave up and put the custom
 * control codes into separate C# project.
 * An extra benefit is that can use these controls easily in C# projects too.
